# Qadabra tutorial
Qadabra is a Snakemake workflow for running and comparing several differential abundance (DA) methods (tools) on the same microbiome dataset.

In this tutorial, we will run Qadabra on a small dataset to guide you through its usage. This dataset is comprised of skin microbiome samples swabbed from individuals with acne and sequenced by shotgun metagenomics. A clinical trial was conducted where a topical skin cream containing a strain of _Staphylococcus capitis_ that produces a potent antimicrobial peptide against _Cutibacterium acnes_ (the bacteria most involved with acne) was applied on research volunteers to see if their acne improved. This tutorial will investigate how the individuals' skin microbiome changed by differential abundance analysis of microbes pre- and post-treatment from this study using Qadabra.

## 1. Installation
We recommend installing [mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mamba-installation.html) to manage your Qadabra environment. (Note that mamba can interfere with existing conda environments; check [this StackOverflow thread](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76514281/conda-environments-name-missing-after-mamba-installation) if planning to run both mamba and conda side by side.)  Once mamba is installed, create and activate your Qadabra environment:
```
mamba create -n qadabra_env python=3.9
mamba activate qadabra_env
mamba install snakemake numpy cython
```
Install Qadabra and its additional dependencies using [pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/):
```
pip install qadabra click biom-format pandas iow
```

## 2. Create the workflow directory
```
qadabra create-workflow --workflow-dest my_qadabra
cd my_qadabra
```
You have now created a directory called `my_qadabra` with two subdirectories inside, `config` and `workflow`.

## 3. Create the dataset directory and download tutorial files
Create a `data` directory to put your input files.
```
mkdir data
```
Navigate to the `tutorial_data` directory in the Qadabra GitHub repo:
`qadabra/qadabra/test_data/`.
Download `qadabra_tutorial_table.biom` and `qadabra_tutorial_metadata.tsv` and move these files to your newly created `data` directory.

## 4. Add your dataset to the Qadabra workflow
In the same level as your `my_qadabra` directory, run the following with the `add-dataset` command:
```
qadabra add-dataset \
    --workflow-dest my_qadabra \
    --table my_qadabra/data/qadabra_tutorial_table.biom \
    --metadata my_qadabra/data/qadabra_tutorial_metadata.tsv \
    --name skin_microbiome \
    --factor-name group \
    --target-level Day_90 \
    --reference-level Baseline \
    --verbose
```
You can check that your dataset was added by navigating to `config/datasets.tsv`.

## 5. Running the workflow

From the command line, execute the following to start the workflow:
```
snakemake --use-conda --cores 4
```
(This took approximately 8 minutes to run on a MacBook Pro, 2.6 GHz Quad-Cores Intel Core i7 with 16GB of RAM).

## 6. Generating a report

After Qadabra has finished running, you can generate a Snakemake report of the workflow with the following command:

```
snakemake --report report.zip
```

This will create a zipped directory containing the report.
Unzip this file and open the `report.html` file to view the report containing results and visualizations in your browser.



## Exploring Qadabra outputs

Qadabra generates many results files and intermediate files that can be explored further.

#### Results files

The differential abundance results from Qadabra are outputted in terms of FDR corrected p-values and feature ranks. 
These results can be found in the `results/<dataset_name>/` directory. Let's walkthrough the Qadabra results files: 
* `concatenated_differentials.tsv`: TSV table containing the differentials from each method.
* `concatenated_pvalues.tsv`: TSV table containing the FDR corrected p-values from each method.
* `differentials_table.html`: HTML table displaying concatenated_differentials.tsv.
* `pvalues_table.html`: HTML table displaying concatenated_pvalues.tsv.
* `qadabra_all_result.tsv`: TSV table containing differentials, FDR corrected p-values, and the number of methods passing significance threshold of 0.05 for each feature. (This table is used as the metadata for EMPress if a phylogenetic tree input is present.)

Each method's individual outputs are stored in a separate subdirectory under the `results/<dataset_name>/methods/<method>` subdirectories. 
* `differentials.tsv`: This file contains the differential abundance results as outputted by each individiual method.
* `differentials.processed.tsv`: This file extracts just the differentials column from differentials.tsv.
* `pvalues.processed.tsv`: This file extracts just the p-value column from differentials.tsv.
* `results.rds`: For the R methods (all except Songbird), an RDS object with the method's R data is saved.

A [Qurro](https://github.com/biocore/qurro) visualization of all the method ranks is generated at `results/<dataset_name>/qurro/index.html`.

For each method, the ranked features are used for machine learning models.
The `results/<dataset_name>/ml` subdirectory of each method contains the features used, sample log-ratios, and compressed model objects.

Results from the PCA analysis can be found under `results/<dataset_name>/pca`.

## Interpretations
In this example dataset, all differential abundance methods agree by both p-values and differentials that _Staphylococcus capitis_ is differentially abundant in the 90 Days Post-Treatment samples compared to the Baseline (not treated with _S. capitis_) as expected based on the design of the clinical trial. Whether the application of the _S. capitis_ strain successfully reduced _Cutibacterium acnes_ populations remains to be debated based on the differential abundance results. However, those tools that do report some species that are statistically decreased at Post-Treatment are mostly _Cutibacterium_ species. The summary plot also agrees with these interpretations and provides a quick way to view the results from QADABRA.



## Additional workflow options

### Workflow subsetting

In some cases you may not want to run the full workflow and may only be interested in just running certain methods.

If you navigate into your `my_qadabra` directory, you should see two folders: `config` and `workflow`. If you open the `config/config.yaml` file, you can see a number of options with which to run Qadabra. You can modify these as you like to eschew certain parts of the workflow.
For example, if you want to only run DESeq2, ANCOM-BC, and Songbird, you can delete the other entries in the `methods` heading.

### Incorporating confounders

You can also specify additional confounders to incorporate into your DA model.
When adding a dataset, use `--confounder <column name>` to add a confounder into your model.
You can add multiple confounders by adding more `--confounder <column name>` arguments to `add-dataset`.

### Phylogenetic visualization

Qadabra allows users to visualize the differentials and p-values on an interactive phylogenetic tree using [EMPress](https://journals.asm.org/doi/10.1128/mSystems.01216-20).
With EMPress, you can annotate the tree with the differentials as barplots.
This can be useful for determining phylogenetic signal in differential abundance. See the [EMPress GitHub](https://github.com/biocore/empress) page for more information and tutorial.
